### Hi, Iâ€™m Maggie
In this repository i hope you can learn more About Me and My Projects related to Computer Programming and Engineering. 

Please take a look at [Health Innovation Challenge](Health%20Innovation%20Challenge) to see my work in Arduino and Python creating demo solutions for a Biomedical Engineering Hackathon!
# About Me
I am a 3rd year Biomedical engineering student at the university of waterloo, and I am also a varsity swimmer/ competitive swimmer of 14 years. My most familiar coding scripts are __Python__ and __Arduino__, with some experience in __C++__.

My work for the past few months has been with a small team developing curricular resources, one being a Health Inovation Challenge in partnership with Grand River Hospital. This Innovation Challenge will be taking place at the University of Waterloo in the IDEA's clinic in a few months following the structre i helped establish. While developing this challenge, i have learned how to integrate python with arduino, take in data from mulitple sensors at one time, and how to process the sensor data into meaningful information regarding the human medical condition.
