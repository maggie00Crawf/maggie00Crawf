## Hospital-Induced Delirium Case Study
Congratulations, you have been employed by Grand River Hospital to lead a new department specializing in the care of the aging community while under the hospital's care. This department was created after learning that elderly patients are at a higher risk of developing hospital-induced delirium. This condition affects almost 53% of all older individuals and up to 87% of patients in intensive care. 

Delirium can be defined as a change in oneâ€™s mental abilities toward a confused, disoriented, or disorganized state. Unlike dementia, which is an irreversible long-term illness, delirium has a rapid onset that does not last as long.

The team is tasked with investigating this problem space and coming up with ways the hospital could mitigate the risks currently threatening the hospitalized aging community. You have been chosen for your ability to problem solve and innovate while working in an interdisciplinary team. During the first few weeks of your employment, your team has been extensively researching hospital-induced delirium, its causes, symptoms, detection methods, and current methods implemented by the hospital. Previous professionals have compiled research from this problem space into 4 categories based on a few ways in which the problem can be approached.
* The use of AI-trained chatbots to reduce loneliness and provide mental health resources;
* The monitoring of delirium risk factors related to patient condition and patient environment;
* Use of technology to physically and mentally stimulate patients with delirium;
* Configuring patient interests and personal information into an accessible platform for volunteers.

You have been given the freedom to dive deeper into one of these categories or to come up with a unique way to tackle the issue of geriatric hospital-induced delirium. As long as you stay relevant to the problem space, the sky is the limit!

But hurry! You must get started on your solution quickly since the hospital is hosting a charity event where all the investors will be present. These investors are itching for new ideas, so if you want to pitch an idea your team must produce a proof-of-concept prototype in two days to pitch to the hospital's investors while they are in town.
