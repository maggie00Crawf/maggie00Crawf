# Tackling Loneliness and Social Isolation

## Case Study 

Loneliness is a recognized risk factor for cognitive decline, anxiety, and delirium, particularly in elderly or long-term hospitalized patients. Research shows that socially isolated patients are 1.5 times more likely to develop delirium due to emotional strain, confusion, and disorientation. 

Grand River Hospital faces a challenge: How to reduce loneliness in patients when staff and family visits are limited. AI-powered companions—designed to provide conversation, emotional support, and cognitive stimulation—are emerging as a potential solution. These technologies have been proven to alleviate loneliness in some elderly care settings. 

Your task is to investigate the role of loneliness in the onset of delirium while exploring innovative and practical ways to mitigate it. Consider how AI companions or other technologies could help address loneliness and prevent delirium while maintaining ethical and practical considerations. AI companions are known to be very susceptible to bias and misinformation, so a challenge will be to provide training and run tests to ensure such biases do not occur.

This case encourages you to explore solutions like AI companions, ChatBots, and the reliability of online health resources. How will you help Grand River Hospital address loneliness to reduce delirium?
