# Detecting Irregular Speech Pattern

## Case Study
Studies have shown that delirium can lead to a range of speech abnormalities, including incoherence, disorganized thought processes, and difficulty maintaining attention during conversations. Patients may demonstrate slurred speech, repetitive phrases, or fragmented sentences making it harder for healthcare professionals to diagnose the condition promptly.

The speech irregularities in delirium are not just cognitive but also emotional. Patients may express heightened levels of fear or distress in their speech, which can manifest as sudden changes in tone or speed. These abnormalities are subtle but critical indicators of an underlying condition.
You are tasked with finding a way to better understand and monitor these speech changes. While speech recognition technology and natural language processing (NLP) tools have been explored for detecting mood disorders and cognitive decline, they have not yet been thoroughly applied to detecting the onset of delirium and you can choose to do so if you wish. Your role is to help the hospital develop new insights into how speech can be used as a diagnostic tool for delirium.
Drawing on interdisciplinary research, your task is to:
- Investigate the specific speech patterns associated with delirium.
- Explore innovative ways to measure and analyze these patterns using available technology.
- Consider how early detection of delirium through speech can lead to better patient outcomes.

You are not expected to propose a fully-fledged solution, but to explore different avenues for identifying delirium using speech-related data. Consider the ethical, medical, and technical implications of your research and present your findings with suggested next steps. Suggest what sort of data you might require for such a solution if you cannot find it readily available.
