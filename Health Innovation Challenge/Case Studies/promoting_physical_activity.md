# Promoting Physical Activity

## Case Study

Healthcare professionals at Grand River Hospital have noticed that long-term hospitalized senior patients, aged 65-85, are experiencing a lack of physical activity. These patients, recovering from surgeries, chronic illnesses, or undergoing long-term treatments, often feel discouraged from exercising due to physical constraints. With limited experience using smartphones and other smart devices, television has become one of their primary sources of entertainment, but it is not always available in every ward. Consequently, many patients spend most of their time in bed, leading to boredom and inactivity.

Recognizing that immobility significantly contributes to hospital-induced delirium, the healthcare team is seeking technology-driven solutions to promote engaging physical exercises with varying difficulty levels, providing both physical and mental stimulation. The hospital faces challenges with low patient engagement and is now turning to you for help.

The team hopes for a technological solution that is simple, enjoyable, and tailored to the patients' needs. This solution should leverage accessible technology to track and monitor users' progress or decline. It must be easy to use, considering the senior population's minimal experience with smart devices, and should offer adjustable intensity levels to prevent exhaustion while enhancing overall well-being.
