- I am a 3rd year Biomedical engineering student at the university of waterloo.
- I am also a varsity swimmer, and competitive swimmer of 14 years

- I have worked for the past few months with a small team to develop the structure for a biomedical design challenge that will be taking place at the University in a few months. while workign on this project i have
	learned how to integrate python with arduino, take in data from mulitple sensors at one time, and how to process the sensor data into meaningful information regarding the human medical condition.
- I am new to coding and did not have much experience before this, but i have found i learned very quickly while working though this project and am now excited to do more similar work.
