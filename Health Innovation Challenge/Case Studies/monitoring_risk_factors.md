# Monitoring Risk Factors

## Case Study
Delirium can present in various ways; some of its symptoms can be normal symptoms of aging, while other symptoms can also overlap with pre-existing conditions. This makes it difficult to pinpoint what is causing a symptom, making it more complicated to treat. Having a detection system for the factors that increase the risk of developing delirium would be an asset to hospitals in the realm of delirium prevention. 

The desired solution would consider the changes in a patientâ€™s physical condition and environment to mitigate the effect these risk factors have on the patient.

### Patient Condition
Some examples of factors that increase the chances of developing hospital-induced delirium are inactivity, irregular sleep patterns, fever, low blood oxygen saturation, dehydration, and serious illnesses.

As the ratio of aging patients in hospitals continues to increase and hospitals remain short-staffed, now more than ever there is a need for, around-the-clock, remote patient monitoring systems. To provide accurate and meaningful data to the staff the desired system would have to be able to read and store relevant data values from the patient while identifying important patterns. There are also important ethical implications that must be considered when dealing with sensitive patient data and devices attached to their person. 

### Environment
The World Health Organization has published noise-level guidelines for various community locations at different times. These values include those of hospital wardrooms and treatment rooms, along with general noise levels that can cause sleep disturbances and awakenings during the night. Excessive noise in treatment locations can interfere with the treatments and recovery time, while noise-induced sleep disturbances contribute to ineffective rest.

Lighting is also something that can be controlled to reduce the chances of developing hospital-induced delirium. Studies show that the most effective method of "light treatment" is to increase the duration of bright natural light the patient is exposed to during the day. If natural light is not possible, exposure to "bright light therapy" (BLT) which shows good results.

Aging decreases the levels of the hormones in our body that we use to control our circadian rhythm. This imbalance can mess with the body's sleep-wake cycle. Providing an external stimulus such as lighting patterns can often help keep this cycle on track.

The hospital needs a way to ensure that its environment is conducive to healing and that there is a minimized risk of developing delirium from hospital conditions. This is where you come in! Think about how your solution will be used, its possible ethical implications, and the practicality of the solution in the problem space environment.
