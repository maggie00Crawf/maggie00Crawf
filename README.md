- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maggie00Crawf
- I am a 3rd year Biomedical engineering student at the university of waterloo, and I am also a varsity swimmer/ competitive swimmer of 14 years
- My most familiar scripts are Python and Arduino, but have some experience in C++
- My work for the past few months has been with a small team developing a Health Inovation Challenge in partnership with Grand RIver Hospital. This "Hackathon" will be taking place at the University in a few months following the structre i helped establish.
	- While developing this challenge, i have learned how to integrate python with arduino, take in data from mulitple sensors at one time, and how to process the sensor data into meaningful information regarding the human medical condition.
- I am new to coding and did not have much experience before this, but i have found i learned very quickly while working though this project and am now excited to do more similar work.
